This assignment creates an algorithm allowing for a group planning an event to seat attendees across multiple tables, ensuring there is not more than one company representative at each table.   The algorithm is flexible to set parameters via variables to determine the maximum number of people via a maximum number of tables and maximum seating capacity per table.  The program loads the participants and companies from input files, performs the validations that the data is correct, provides the option to register additional attendees via a prompt, and subsequently places the attendees on each table.  The program also provides functionality to print rosters per company or per table.  As an additional feature, the program allows one to search for attendees and display the information.  This project has 4 classes which are Attendee (generating objects for the people), Main (to call the methods serving as a tester), Partay (where all the methods are stored), and Company (generating objects for the company)
